A simple 2D platformer, Just install love2d, open it, drag and drop this folder to run. 

Or use command line : 

  love simpleplatformer/ 

and it will run. 

this was just coded using clauded 3 LLM to see how it works and what it takes to get something functional going. overall i 
really liked the framework, its barebones but i have seen people creating some awesome stuff with it. 

Claude 3 coding skills were very impressive, the code generated barely had bugs which i was able to resolve easily.
